Adds a hotkey to ready a light source. Features include automatic reequipping of the weapon if one was unequipped when taking out the light, an MCM to configure the keybind, compatibility with Midnight Oil, and MWSE Containers.

This mod was inspired by the wonderful Torch Hotkey (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45747).
